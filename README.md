# School_District_Analysis
-----------------------------
## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to assist a client named "Maria" in analyzing data on student funding and standardized test scores for a district of fifteen schools to determine what affects replacing ninth-grade math and reading scores for "Thomas High School" with "NaN" values would have on the district-wide analysis.  The motivation for this replacement procedure was to protect the district-wide analysis from potential misrepresentation considering the ninth-grade students of "Thomas High School" had been suspected of academic dishonesty on their test scores.

To perform the analysis, a variety of metrics were calculated and analyzed for each school prior to the data manipulation experiment.  These included the total number of students, the total budget, the average math scores, average reading scores, the percentage of students that passed math, the percentage of students that passed reading, and the percentage of students that passed both math and reading.  Following this initial analysis, the "Thomas High School" student test scores for math and reading of ninth-graders were replaced with "NaN" values and the same analysis was performed to measure and compare the updated metrics results with the original metrics results.
